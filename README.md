# Data structures
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory to efficiently perform operations on that data. It provides a systematic way to manage and manipulate data, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and modification of information.
there is a logical data structure that can be implemented using physical data structure
# logical data structure :
- linked list
- stack
- queue
# physical data structure :
- array based
- linked based
  
  # Linked list 
this program is a single unordered linked list implementation, A linked list is a data structure used for storing and organizing data elements.
It consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains the data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

# program description :

## this operations that user can do :

- check if list is empty or not
- display list information
- search for an item
- insert item in the begening
- insert item in the end
- insert item before an exiting item
- delete item from the begining
- delete item from the end

 # stack :
 A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It resembles a stack of objects, where elements are added and removed from the top.

 # program description :

## this operations that user can do :

- check if list is empty or not
- check if list is full or not
- display list information
- search for an item
- push item in the stack
- pop item from stack
- return top item from stack

 # queue :
 A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It resembles a queue of objects, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front

 # program description :

## this operations that user can do :

- initialize Queue to empty state 
- check if the Queue is empty or not
- check if the Queue is full or not
- enqueue item into queue
- dequeue item from queue
- return front element from queue
- return rear element from queue
- search for an item
- display list info 
- return length of the stack

# How to use application :
 
 - install visuale studio code or code blocks or any IDE use c++
 - downlaod files and run program a menue will appear to choose the operation you want
